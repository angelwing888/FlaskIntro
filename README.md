This is a website run through a localhost that shows the current weather in an inputted city. This was my first time working with Python Flask, CSS, and directly using APIs. 

This was created following this tutorial on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQjjqEjZK58

While doing this project, I:
- Brushed up on Python skills (after like, 7 years)
- Worked with HTML and CSS to create and style the frontend
- Learned how to integrate APIs into a program using API keys
- Activated a localhost server to run the program on a web page for the first time
